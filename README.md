# convolutions
Here we try to explain the relevance of convolutions for extracting relevant featues from images.
Our first kernel is just menta to compute horizontal derivatives.
Next one is the vertical derivative.
Difference between blurrings (simulating the difference between two visions of a same eimage with slightly different focal distances)
Sum of derivatives
Finite Laplacian
Identity
Reinforcement
Embossing
